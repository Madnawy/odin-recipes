    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A simple chicken and red wine recipe with a tasty sauce made from brown sugar, garlic, paprika, salt, and pepper. Everything balanced together makes this dish comforting and yummy! Braised chicken breasts, brazenly good taste.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>3 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup red wine</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>    
    </ul>
    <ol>Steps</ol>
    <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook garlic in oil until tender.</li>
    <li>Place chicken in the skillet, and cook for about 10 minutes on each side, until no longer pink and juices run clear. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Drain oil from the skillet. Sprinkle chicken with paprika and brown sugar.</li>
    <li>Pour red wine around chicken. Cover and simmer, 15 to 20 minutes; lightly baste the chicken with wine sauce while cooking. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
